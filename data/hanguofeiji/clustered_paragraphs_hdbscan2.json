Two “black boxes”—the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recording devices—were recovered from the site, though the Korea Herald reported these boxes could take a month or more to decode. One of the boxes is damaged, the Korea Herald reported, which may require South Korean authorities to transport the box to the U.S.’s NTSB for analysis, which could take up to six months. Investigators are also reportedly investigating the impact of potential bird strikes and weather, whether any of the plane’s control systems were disabled and why the plane’s landing seemed rushed. Aviation experts have also raised questions about the cause of the crash. “Why was the plane going so fast? Why were the flaps not open? Why was the landing gear not down?” aviation expert Gregory Alegi told the Associated Press. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country’s entire airplane operation, including checks of all Boeing 737-800s.",

            "content": "Crashes are often caused by multiple factors, which can take years to uncover through in-depth investigations. Officials were looking into why the landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned.\nAs the plane was landing, the airport warned it about a potential bird strike, said Ju Jong-wan, a director of aviation policy at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The plane issued a mayday alert shortly after, he said, then crash-landed.\nThe pilot aborted his first attempt at landing, then after receiving permission from the control tower, tried to land from the opposite direction when the disaster happened, officials said. Planes were allowed to land from both directions at the airport, they said.\nThe muddy tidal flats near Muan International Airport and much of the west coast of the Korean Peninsula are favorite resting places for migrant birds.\nFootage broadcast by MBC-TV showed one of the engines briefly emitting flames as it neared the airport.\nThe plane’s landing gear appeared not to have dropped down from underneath, and the flaps on its wings apparently were not activated for landing, said Keith Tonkin, the managing director of Aviation Projects, an aviation consulting company in Brisbane, Australia, who reviewed video of the crash.\n“The aircraft was essentially in a flying configuration,” he said. That meant the plane was most likely “flying faster than it would normally be in a landing situation.”\nKim E-bae, the chief executive of Jeju Air, said at a news conference that the plane had no history of accidents and that no problems were found during routine maintenance checks. The airport in Bangkok that the plane had taken off from said that there were no reports of abnormal conditions with the aircraft.",

            "content": "Moments before the crash of Jeju Air flight 2216, a passenger aboard texted a friend that the Boeing 737-800 aircraft had struck a bird.\n“Wait a minute… we can’t land because a bird (or birds) caught in our wing,” the passenger said at 9 am local time, on a Korean messaging platform, KakaoTalk, according to messages widely shared in South Korean media, including CNN affiliate JTBC.\n“Since when?” the other person asked.\n“Just now… Should I leave last words?” the passenger responded, before contact was lost.\nThe possible bird strike, lack of landing gear deployment and concrete barrier all could have contributed to the aviation accident, which has been labeled as the deadliest in South Korea since 1997. However, the cause of the crash has yet to be determined just days after the tragedy. It could be months before we know why flight 2216 crashed. Sometimes, what the public believes caused a crash turns out to be far off base once an investigation concludes.\nUS officials, including the National Transportation Safety Board, plane maker Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, are working with South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board to provide more information about the incident.\nDespite the crash, the Boeing 737-800 has a very strong safety record, unlike its successor 737 Max model that has had numerous problems. Boeing data from 1959 to 2023 shows the 737-800 recorded just 10 fatal accidents that damaged aircraft beyond repair, one of lowest rates in the industry when compared to the number of flights they’ve flown.\nAdditionally, South Korea’s safety record has been exceptional, according to Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit that identifies global safety issues to improve aviation.\nHe said South Korean airlines all have safety management systems in place and have done well with respect to International Civil Aviation Organization audits that have been performed. ICAO is the United Nations agency that helps 193 countries work together in air travel.\n“This accident is very, very sad with the loss of life that we have seen,” Shahidi said. “It’s a complicated accident that involves many, many different factors that the investigators will be looking into to really understand the confluence of those factors that led to this disaster.”",

After an initial failed landing attempt, the Boeing 737-800 plane received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. The pilot then issued a distress signal before the plane came down with its front landing gear closed, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball.\nObservers say videos of the crash showed the plane was suffering from suspected engine trouble, but the landing gear malfunction was likely the main reason for the crash.\nSouth Korean Transport Ministry officials said Monday they will examine whether the fence the plane hit — which housed a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. They said they were also trying to establish whether there were any communication problems between air traffic controllers and the pilot.\nMinistry officials said Monday the plane’s flight data and cockpit audio recorders were moved to a research center at Seoul’s Gimpo International Airport ahead of their analysis. Ministry officials earlier said it would take months to complete the investigation of the crash.",

Only two of the 181 people on Flight 7C2216 survived.\nThe exact cause of the accident is under investigation, but South Korean Transport Ministry officials say the control tower issued a bird strike warning minutes before the pilots declared a mayday and attempted to land. The twin-engine Boeing 737-800 appeared to belly land on the runway before skidding into a wall and erupting into flames.\n“This plane appears to have landed at an extremely high speed. It does not appear that the landing flaps were extended,” airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt told USA TODAY. “There are a lot of questions about why that is the case: if there was a hydraulic failure or if everything just happened so fast, if indeed there was a bird strike and were the birds ingested into both engines? Lots of unknown factors here.”\nHowever, one thing is certain: “Commercial aviation statistically remains the safest form of transportation,” he said.\nHere’s what travelers should know.",

Experts said it is premature to place the blame on Boeing until more information has been made public, but, as of now, there are no signs that the aircraft’s manufacturing was responsible for the crash.\nArmstrong acknowledged it’s unseemly to point to pilot error but knows that the cause can often be the fault of the crew.\n“The spotlight will always be drawn to the pilot training,” Armstrong said. “We’re definitely trying to run pilots through training much faster, trying to do it as efficiently as we can, but boy, until we hear the words from the pilot and the cockpit of what was going on, then we can spotlight where it needs to be.”\nThe International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations published a statement saying it is closely monitoring the developments related to the crash and working closely with local member association, ALPA-K. “The Federation urges caution against speculation in media and social media surrounding the accident,” the statement added.\nThere are three main things the National Transportation Safety Board will examine in investigations, according to Ed Malinowski, a retired senior air safety investigator for the NTSB and a former airline transport pilot: the pilot, the environment and the aircraft.\n“When you get to an accident site, you capture as many things that will not be there tomorrow as they are when you get there,” Malinowski said.\nICAO will allow for US agencies, like the NTSB and FAA, to assist South Korea in the investigation, he said.\nICAO references 19 technical annexes to maintain uniformity in international civil aviation. Annex 13 outlines how accident investigation participation is determined.\nDue to Annex 13, Boeing, the NTSB and the FAA have all declined to comment further on the matter, but the regulation requires the issuance of an accident investigation preliminary report within 30 days of the event and a final report, as soon as possible or within a year of the event.",

            "content": "What we do know is that the plane was inbound from Bangkok, Thailand, to Muan, South Korea, with 175 passengers and six crew members when it apparently flew into a flock of birds and sucked at least one into an engine as it came in to land. Video taken from the ground appears to show a puff of smoke coming from the plane’s right engine, signaling a compressor stall that would have caused the engine to lose some if not all of its thrust.\nThe flight crew declared an emergency and aborted the landing. Around this time, the plane stopped transmitting its speed and location data via an automatic system called ADS-B, which lets the plane be tracked on websites like FlightRadar24. At the moment of its final transmission, the plane was a mile and half from the approach end of the runway and about 500 feet above the surface.\nThe aircraft swung around to attempt a landing coming in from the north. As it approached the end of the runway, it seemed to be under positive control of the flight crew but was not configured in the normal way for landing with flaps down and landing gear deployed. As a result, it was flying faster than normal and so had more speed to lose before it could settle onto the ground. Video appears to show the thrust reversers deployed, but they apparently did little to slow the plane.\nBy the time the 737 eventually did settle onto the ground, it was far down the runway. It then careered off the end of the asphalt and hit a berm at more than 100 mph. The fuselage broke up and burst into flames. The only survivors were two flight attendants who were strapped into backward-facing seats with shoulder harnesses at the very back of the plane.\nOnce crash investigators recover the black boxes and listen to what the pilots were saying in the cockpit, it will likely become clear what they were intending to do and how the incident unfolded. For now, aviation experts find several aspects of the crash deeply puzzling.",

The diversion was caused by a medical, not technical, emergency onboard, according to the Incheon International Airport Police Corps.\nAfter that, the plane flew 10 flights between South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, China, Taiwan and Thailand without incident, according to Flightradar24, before Sunday morning’s crash.\nIn 2021, the South Korean authorities investigated Jeju Air after one of its planes flew despite having a defect, according to reports in the domestic news media. A tip of one of its wings was damaged during a landing, but the crew failed to notice the damage and the plane took off again, The Korea Herald reported.\nLast year, the airline received a safety grade of A, or “very good,” from the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s annual review of domestic airlines.

However officials will examine whether it should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.\nSouth Korean officials have said the structure was about 250m (820ft) from the end of the runway and most airports in the country follow international rules recommending a safety area of 240m (787ft).\nHowever, remarks in the airport's operating manual, uploaded early in 2024, said the embankment was too close to the end of the runway and recommended that the location of the equipment be reviewed during a planned expansion.\nFormer pilot John Cox, chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, told Reuters the runway design \"absolutely (did) not\" meet industry best practices, which preclude any hard structure within at least 300m (984ft) of the end of the runway.\nSouth Korea's director-general for airport policy, Kim Hong-rak, said the government would \"review the relevant regulations and their application\".\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Jeju Air's chief executive Kim Yi-bae appeared to sidestep a question about the wall.\nAsked by a reporter if he thought the wall was a factor in the disaster, he did not give a direct answer and instead said it was right to call the plane crash the Jeju Air disaster, rather than the Muan Air disaster.",

The last deadly crash in South Korea occurred in 1997 when a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed in the Guam jungle, killing 228 people. Many airports don’t have similar structures so close to runways, according to aviation experts.\n“I just cannot think of anything more irresponsible than what (South Korea aviation officials) have done,” said Shawn Pruchnicki, an assistant professor in the college of engineering at Ohio State University. “In my opinion, they are responsible for the amount of people that were killed because of that design.”\nHe said the crash would not have been as deadly had it not been for the concrete embankment. Pruchnicki was also a witness at a US congressional hearing in April about Boeing’s safety culture.\nThe FAA defines the surface surrounding runways as “runway safety areas,” which are typically 500 feet wide and extend 1,000 feet beyond each runway end.\nShahidi said investigators will take a further look at the barrier to determine whether it was in compliance with international standards for runway construction.\n“It’s just unconscionable that you would put a concrete barrier, because what that does is that guarantees destruction and death to the occupants of an airplane that’s going to hit,” Pruchnicki said.\nThe two flight attendants seated at the back of the jet who survived, Armstrong said, probably didn’t feel the force of the wall.",

That wall held a navigational system called a localizer that's meant, ironically, to help planes land safely.\nWhile localizer structures are common at airports, they're generally not supposed to be placed at the end of runways like the one at Muan, experts told the BBC.\nAir safety specialist David Learmont told the broadcaster that if the \"obstruction,\" as he called the localizer structure, hadn't been positioned in such an inopportune place at the end of the runway, the jet \"would have come to rest with most — possibly all — those on board still alive.\"\nChristian Beckert, a Lufthansa pilot out of Germany, was even more blunt: \"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall.\"",

The control tower had warned the pilot of birds in the area before the reported strike. \nThe pilot declared “mayday, mayday, mayday” three times and used the terms “bird strike” and “go-around,” the official said. \nGlobally, wildlife strikes with civilian and military aircraft combined have killed more than 491 people and destroyed over 350 aircraft from 1988 to 2023, according to a report from the FAA.  In the United States, wildlife strikes with civilian and military aircraft have killed 76 people and destroyed 126 aircraft from 1988 to 2023. \nThere’s still much uncertainty to how much a bird strike could have played into the crash. \nThe tragic even has so many layers, and everything at the moment is speculation, said Erika Armstrong, a pilot and former contract worker at Boeing.  Armstrong is the director of marketing and vice president of business development at Advanced Aircrew Academy, an aviation e-learning firm that trains pilots, flight attendants and crew. \nMore concrete information will be available after investigators review the two “black boxes,” the flight data and voice recorders, from the crash site, she said. \nA bird strike, she explained, could have caused an engine to fail in such a way that it may have knocked out the plane’s hydraulics. \n“Never say never in aviation,” Armstrong said.  “We train for engine failures all the time – it’s an expectation. ”\nStatistically speaking, bird strikes don’t happen often, however, in recent years, instances have been climbing.  In 2023, 19,603 strikes were reported, an increase of 14% compared to the 17,205 strikes reported in 2022, according to the FAA. \nShahidi said if there was a bird strike, investigators will be looking if it destroyed one or both engines, which will be critical. \n“From the time that the crew declared ‘May Day’ emergency, it was only about five minutes before the aircraft landed and crashed, so there was little time in that to for the pilots to be able to do what they needed to do,” Shahidi said.

Problems with an undercarriage are not unusual. Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" he said.",

If the engines were functioning well enough to allow this, there should have been time to fly to a nearby area where the crew could maintain a holding pattern while running through checklists to troubleshoot the problems. They could have asked for help from the ground, from their airline’s maintenance department, for example. Instead, they rushed to get the plane back on the ground, and in their haste, they seem to have skipped important steps that would have made the odds of survival much better. “We always used to say, ‘No fast hands in the cockpit,’” Brauchle says. “If something happens, just take a beat.”\nIt’s worth noting that even if the 737 had suffered some kind of mechanical failure that prevented the flight crew from deploying the landing gear, that doesn’t mean the plane couldn’t have been landed without loss of life. In 2011, a Boeing 767 operated by Poland’s LOT Airlines suffered a failure of its hydraulic system that made it impossible to lower the landing gear. The plane circled the airport at Warsaw for more than an hour to burn off as much fuel as possible, then conducted a carefully planned belly landing that left everyone onboard uninjured.",

Experts later confirmed to CNN that the plane’s wheels used for takeoff and landing did not fully deploy before landing.  There is no official explanation yet for why. \nArmstrong said you can manually drop the gear on a Boeing 737, but, given the amount of time that elapsed from engine failure to landing, the pilots couldn’t have even begun to run through a checklist to drop the gear.  She called it a “workout” for pilots to drop the gear manually. \nThe 101 Boeing 737-800 jets operated by South Korean airlines will be inspected this week, according to South Korean officials.",
